# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front End

This repository contains the front-end portion of the What to Wear (WTWR) application. The back-end portion can be found [HERE](https://github.com/rachelleperez/se_project_express). This application outputs the weather and appropriate clothing item recommendations based on a specific location.

This front-end portion represents the client side of the app which receives user input, makes API calls to server (to source weather data and retrieve user data safely), and displays content. Below are a few components:

- Welcome Page, with weather-appropriate clothing items
- User Profile page, with all available clothing items for this user
- Edit User Profile
- Add Clothing Item

## Technologies Used

This project relies on the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
  - React framework: to create components
- MongoDB: to store data on user and clothing items
  - Mongoose
- JWT (JSON Web Token): to identify authenticated users

## Running the Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
